Hi, I'm Khadijah! I graduated with a degree in Economics, but my true passion lies in illustration and graphic design. I’m currently working full-time as a freelance graphic designer and illustrator, creating meaningful and visually captivating artwork. This website is a collection of my work, showcasing the journey I’ve taken through creativity and design.


**The sample of my projects that can be public can be seen here:**

- [Children's Book Illustrations](/projects/1_project/)
- [Simple Animation](/projects/2_project/)
- [Event Brochure](/projects/3_project/)
- [Baby Diary Book](/projects/4_project/)
- [Lettering & Typography](/projects/5_project/)

In my free time, I also enjoy creating content such as: [Instagram Reels](https://www.instagram.com/khadijahasim/reels/), [TikTok Videos](https://www.tiktok.com/@khadijahasim1), [YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/alkwangju). Some of the content has very good engagement.

Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaborating!
